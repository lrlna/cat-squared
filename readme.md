# CAT POPULATION GROWTH

This week I encountered a strange occurance of cat population growth in my :house:. A friend, [Mattias](https://twitter.com/mpjme) [proceeded to ask](https://twitter.com/mpjme/status/794962062040596480) about the population growth over a lifetime, which I thought was an interesting argument, so I made a package to find this out :cat: :cat2:

You, too, can find out the number of cats that will appear in your house over your lifetime, if you, too, will encounter a similar problem.

## install

```
npm install -g cat-squared
```

## use

This package is using [prompt](github.com/flatiron/prompt), and it will ask you *all* the :crystal_ball: v important questions :crystal_ball: that it needs to get you the answer you're looking for; therefore, you can just run in your terminal :kissing_heart:

```bash
cat-squared get-cats
```
